# RT-MAF
A Powerful Realtime Fraud &amp; Malware Detection Framework

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Idea and Implementation
Fraudulent App Detection in the financial sector. Our solution aimed at providing a comprehensive self sufficient software that could detect fraudulent apps both reactively and proactively in areas such as betting, investment, loan fraud, and fantasy sports on the Google Play Store before or even after they could commence operations and harm unsuspecting citizens.

We have collected various information from the Google Play Store using a google play scraper and developed a host of some models to detect fraudulent apps, including sentiment analysis, RC analysis, version tracer, description model, developer record analysis, and metric analysis, most of which were based on machine learning and other heuristic algorithms and were trained on data from official sources.
